    "ChemEnv is a fast and robust tool to automatically identify coordination environments (e.g. tetrahedral, octahedral, icosahedral, ...) in a structure. The package is in pymatgen/analysis/chemenv and a script (get_environments.py) is provided in the pymatgen/scripts directory for simple usages. For more advanced usages, you should write your own script(s).\n",

    "Describing materials and compounds in terms of the coordination environments of their constituent atoms is a common and useful practice amongst chemists, crystallographers and materials scientists. The ChemEnv package allows to identify the model coordination environment to which a given (slightly or highly distorted) local environment is the closest. Model coordination environments have been taken from the following two references that were published by the Internation Union of Crystallographers and the Internation Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry respectively :\n",

    "The \"get_environments.py\" script is available in pymatgen/scripts. It should be installed automatically when you install pymatgen and should thus be available directly in a terminal. The script is self explanatory. Just run it by issuing \"get_environment.py\" in a terminal.\n",

    "By default, the script will ask you the path to the CIF file of the structure you want to analyze. The script is also able to get a structure directly from the MaterialsProject database using the MaterialsProject id. In order to use this feature, you should setup the connection to the MaterialsProject by issuing \"get_environment.py -s\". Just follow the instructions of this setup option in order to setup the connection to the MaterialsProject. You can also specify other options (related to the procedure of identification of the coordination environments).\n",
